# Contribution Guidelines

Like any "awesome" list, it's tempting to throw everything into the list, which, alas, defeats the entire purpose of it being "curated". So, while contributions are gratefully welcome, not all will be merged. There is currently one rule: your suggestion must either require Java 8, or offer a "modern Java" way of doing things. The latter is, admittedly, ambiguous and biased, but will hopefully become more clear over time.

If you'd like to create a Pull Request, please follow these rules:

* Don't submit a tool that already exists, or has been rejected. Search through the repository to see if your suggestion has been previously rejected. Disagree? File an issue and let's talk!
* One submission per Pull Request. I know this can be a pain, but otherwise it means I may reject the entire PR even if only one of your additions is being rejected.
* If the suggestion doesn't fit within an existing section, feel free to create a new one.
* Follow the existing format for entries.
* Descriptions should be, well, descriptive and provide a little bit of detail. 1-3 sentences per item is about right.

If you have questions, disagreements, etc., create an issue and let's discuss.
