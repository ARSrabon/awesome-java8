# About This List

I created this list because if I'm going to be writing Java code, I want to take advantage of the great features in Java 8. I wasn't able to find a curated list that took advantage of those features. There's already an [awesome Java](https://github.com/akullpp/awesome-java) list, or two, but I couldn't tell which ones were Java 8 and which ones weren't, so here's my attempt.
